# specifications
Specifications for the smøken-cpu.

## intent
This repository will contain the specifications for the smøken computer, which is aimed to be an educational microcomputer project that implements some unorthodox features in its architecture. These specifications are meant to be independent of the implementation's word size.

## purpose
The contents of this repository will hopefully be used to implement a fully working microcomputer at the [REDACTED] hackerspace.
